# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

### Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
- Attcker injects an SQL command instead of a correct salesperson ID in the URL scheme
- This queries the database and causes the site to load for up to 5 seconds
- Running multipe instnces of this exploit could cause the site to experience a Denial of Service

### Vulnerability #2: Session Hijcking
- This site allows for session hijacking by using the change session tool accidentially left in production by developers

## Green

### Vulnerability #1: Cross Site Scripting
- XSS can be inserted into the user's feedback form
- The script executes when the user checks their feedback page

Script inserted:
``<script>alert('Gotcha!');</script>``

### Vulnerability #2:  Username Enumeration
- This site contians the Username Enumeration flaw because the error messages differ is the username exists or doesn't exist
- Getting an Error message for PPerson displyas in bold while getting an error message for a username that does not exist is not bold

## Red
### Vulnerability #1: IDOR
- The site allows anyone to view unpublished salespeople 
- ID: 10: Testy McTesterson (Supposed to published at a later date)
- ID: 11: Lazy Lazyman (Fired for viewing)

### Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
- Red does not check the CSRF token when forms are submitted
- Therefore, an attacker could create a form hosted elswhere that could send a post request to the site because
it is ignoring the token
- This lack of token verification can be shown in Burp
